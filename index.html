    <div id="about" class="tab-content">
    <p>I was born in March 7, 1994. I love animals and technology.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Miami, with 3 other siblings, Making me a quadruplet. While growing up and going to school I decided to start my studies in Nursing. After short period I switch my degree to Fire-rescue and then to law enforcement. During some time I decided to pursue a career in coding and leave my career as a Police Officer.</p>
      <p>The advance is technology has always interested me and grabbed my attention. On show that sparked my interest would be “ghost in the shell”</p>
        <p>A great show. It is a sci-fi fantasy show taking place in the future where AI has advance to think and operate on it own and there is cyber limbs to replace any damage. It is like CyberPunk.</p>

    <p>Even though I had a great job working as a police officer and lot of avenues I can travel with it it was not my thing. It like when u see a sweat treat and want it but once you take a bite u decide that you do not enjoy the treat. What are you going to do after eating that treat? Keep eating or get a different treat. I chose to get a different treat that I wanted from the beginning. Coding is the future and will be a very important thing as technology advance.</p>

<div id="goals" class="tab-content">
  <p>Traveling is a great way to experience the world but we get tied down by our own means and never do it. I wanted a job that allows me to travel and experience the world. Traveling is relaxing. There is so much to see in the world and working all day in an office to go home sleep and then back to work does not seem like fun. I dream of traveling all 50 countries in the United States and then travel to other countries.</p>
